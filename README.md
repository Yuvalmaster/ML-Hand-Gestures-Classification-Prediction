## Project Description

The project that aims to predict hand gestures using data collected from a wearable device's gyroscope and accelerometer. 
This project involves several key steps to process the collected sensor data and generate accurate hand gesture predictions. 
These steps include data sampling, filtering, event triggering, feature extraction, feature selection, and classification. 
The entire project is implemented in MATLAB, with all the necessary functions organized within the Functions folder.

To request access to the Data, Train, and Test folders, please send me an email, and I will be glad to provide you with a link that includes all the files.
